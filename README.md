Charlotte Wright: Coding

Luis Nova: Design

Design Choices:
The design of the site is very heavily based off of the apple.com website's design. The font (Helvetica neue) and the color scheme of white, black, and grey can all be found on the apple websites pages. To keep the theme of the site (being a tech site focused on promoting its products), I took the product info that our IA, James, set up and displayed it in a column layout, following the patterns found on the apple site's main page promotion of its own products.
